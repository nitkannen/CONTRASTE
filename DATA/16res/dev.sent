The food is very average ... the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
we love th pink pony .
the food is decent .
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
The food was bland oily .
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
This place is great .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
Rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one
I had a great time at Jekyll and Hyde !
The food was good too .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
Great service , great food .
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN !
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicious the food and the service was .
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
All the staff is absolutely professional ! !
This restaurant was way overhyped .
It 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
The price is reasonable although the service is poor .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
Very affordable and excellent ambient !
We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
Cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
The lox is always fresh too .
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
The wine the service was very good too .
Great staff .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
This place is always packed .
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
Food is excellent .
Fish is so very fresh .
Love YUKA .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
I absolutely Loved this place .
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
The place was nice and calm .
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
Authentic Taiwanese food that 's cheap ... what more could you ask for ?
Kind , attentive wait staff .
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
Great sushi experience .
This place is not worth the prices .
Love Pizza 33 ...
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) .
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
The food was exceptional .
it 's a perfect place to have a amazing indian food .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion ... try the potato stuff kanish best one .
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
Great food , great decor , great service .
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
Good drink .
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .
skip dessert .
Pizza was a little soggy .
This place is a great bargain .
The design and atmosphere is just as good .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
The food 's as good as ever .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ...
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
Love Al Di La
An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .
But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing .
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !
We had half/half pizza , mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza !
Reliable , Fresh Sushi
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n't tip more than 10 % .
The place is a bit hidden away , but once you get there , it 's all worth it .
Good food : my favorite is the seafood spaghetti .
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean .
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
The waitress was not attentive at all .
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly .
In the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... )
Great Indian Food !
This is one of my favorite spot , very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .
Love their drink menu .
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that 's more lemony than smoky .
The drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !
Great food , amazing service , this place is a class act .
Paul , the maitre d ' , was totally professional and always on top of things .
The bar drinks were Eh , ok to say the least .
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free '' appetizer of olives was disappointing .
short and sweet – seating is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private .
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had !
Food took some time to prepare , all worth waiting for .
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .
It 's a great place to order from or sit-in .
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .
I 've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .
Everything on the menu is great .
Bison was quite excellent however .
All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .
However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
The nakgi-bokum was horrible .
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
The wife had the risotto which was amazing .
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .
The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .
The family seafood entree was very good .
Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .
The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !
But nonetheless -- great spot , great food .
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .
