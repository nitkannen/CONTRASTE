Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' perks ' were great .
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .
it 's a perfect place to have a amazing indian food .
Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
Not too crazy about their sake martini .
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d ' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !
For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away .
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
even the wine by the glass was good .
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .
The food was just awful , ATROCIOUS actually .
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
The service is awful .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
It 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .
Delivery is fast too .
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor .
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .
Good food .
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
The sides were ok and incredibly salty .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful !
Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread ) .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .
The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .
All the food was hot tasty .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
The staff is no nonsense .
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
But the coconut rice was good .
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place .
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .
First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .
Authentic food and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
Prices are in line .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
While this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs .
Great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) .
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
Consistently good Japanese Tapas .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer .
Service was quick .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had .
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices .
Reasonable prices .
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I 'm used to .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
The noodle and rices dishes taste great .
The food 's as good as ever .
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
While they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city .
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
If you go to Roth 's try to be served by Mike , he is GREAT ! !
The food is amazing ! ! ! !
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend .
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
The drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced .
Food was average but tasty .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai .
Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
Disappointing food , lousy service .
Over price , and small portions .
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .
Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .
The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .
The location is perfect .
The lunch special is an absolute steal .
The chicken pot pie is exceptional , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
Apparently , the good cook works then .
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I 've had .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) .
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
Great staff .
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .
Great vibe , lots of people .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
Great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
If you love seafood , you would love this place !
They charge different prices all the time .
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers .
No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
There is no excuse for such lousy service !
So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good .
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
The food was good .
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
The place was nice and calm .
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth it superb food .
We had the most wonderful waitress .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( Anywhere ) .
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .
It 's just O.K . pizza .
What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered .
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala .
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
The food was just OK , I would never go back .
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
I am happy i did the food was awesome .
We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
The pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I 'd never heard of before .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
Incredible food at a very agreeable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
This was the worst dining experience I 've ever had .
Food was okay , nothing great .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
The food however , is what one might expect .
Food is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date .
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
There are much better places in NY with better prices .
The ambience is very calm and quiet .
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the dish was ridiculously small .
The food was pretty traditional but it was hot and good with large portions .
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .
A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
Their sake martini is wonderful .
The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .
Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR ( Quality to Price Ratio ) .
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .
What generous portions !
The wine the service was very good too .
So , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious .
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
The meat dishes were only so-so .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
The service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .
The sushi is also great !
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .
The makhani was OK -- the korma was bland .
Service was very friendly .
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
And the bill was outrageous .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $ 3.00 in NYC .
The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .
Waitstaff is great , very attentive .
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .
The price very reasonable .
The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .
The flavors robust and subtle .
This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .
The service is fantastic .
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY .
Over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .
Killer Sushi !
Plus they made a perfect martini .
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
If it is n't for the food ( A+++ ) , it must be the service or the ambience .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
Just straight up cheap , good food .
Seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .
As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
Just stick with the small dishes !
both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling .
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly !
great eats , good times .
The food was delicious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second !
The food is good , I ca n't lie .
great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though .
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
No you 're going to go back because the food was good .
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef ( usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt ) .
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy 's !
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
Our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic .
Sake collection was excellent ( Try Nanbu Bijin ) , but pricey .
A wonderful place !
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
The service was typical short-order , dinner type .
