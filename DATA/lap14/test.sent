Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .
Set up was easy .
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions .
Other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .
It 's fast , light , and simple to use .
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life ( > 6 hrs ) .
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .
Made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right .
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective .
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics .
But the mountain lion is just too slow .
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .
The battery life is excellent -- 6-7 hours without charging .
I 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8 .
The baterry is very longer .
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great !
It 's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .
This thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything I could ask for .
Keyboard responds well to presses .
Lastly , Windows 8 is annoying .
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .
Only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of ... limited .
It has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it .
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
I was extremely happy with the OS itself .
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
The criticism has waned , and now I 'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing .
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful , well worth it .
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .
They do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind..I love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is Fast and clear as can be .
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows .
However , I can refute that OSX is `` FAST '' .
Enjoy using Microsoft Office !
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
Built-in apps are purely amazing .
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily .
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS .
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support `` accidents '' like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .
It 's light and easy to transport .
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated .
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and USB devices are recognized almost instantly .
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 '' RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
Well designed and fast .
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .
Exactly as posted plus a great value .
The specs are pretty good too .
Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !
I do not like too much Windows 8 .
Startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .
Also stunning colors and speedy
great price free shipping what else can i ask for ! !
This mouse is terrific .
It is really thick around the battery .
And windows 7 works like a charm .
: ) Great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .
: ] It arrived so fast and customer service was great .
tried windows 8 and hated it ! ! !
Set up was a breeze .
But I do NOT like Win8 .
I had the same reasons as most PC users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .
I wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .
I found the mini to be : Exceptionally easy to set up
The sound is nice and loud ; I do n't have any problems with hearing anything .
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
The settings are not user-friendly either .
Thank goodness for OpenOffice !
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .
i love the keyboard and the screen .
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
I 've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5 .
thanks for great service and shipping !
The performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera .
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend .
Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty .
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , TOPS !
It 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .
It feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .
Though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .
Does everything I need it to , has a wonderful battery life and I could n't be happier .
Great Performance and Quality .
One more thing , this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables .
The new os is great on my macbook pro !
I have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .
System is running great .
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad .
Easy to set up and go !
I ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .
It 's just what we were looking for and it works great .
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
It works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .
I wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .
I use it mostly for content creation ( Audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .
Screen is bright and gorgeous .
It is robust , with a friendly use as all Apple products .
It is fast and easy to use .
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help
Nice screen , keyboard works great !
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was .
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
It works great and I am so happy I bought it .
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser .
I like the lighted screen at night .
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .
I 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones .
It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place .
The battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price .
! Excellent performance , usability , presentation and time response .
The smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .
I blame the Mac OS .
I like the operating system .
I love the form factor .
It 's fast at loading the internet .
So much faster and sleeker looking .
Unfortunately , it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April .
First off , I really do like my MBP ... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit .
Very nice unibody construction .
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
It 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which I did n't know until after I bought it .
There is no HDMI receptacle , nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device .
It came in brand new and works perfectly .
It should n't happen like that , I do n't have any design app open or anything .
MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING .
It looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product .
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
The configuration is perfect for my needs .
and the speakers is the worst ever .
Its the best , its got the looks , super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad ! ..
Web surfuring is smooth and seamless .
I 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .
This item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
It was also suffering from hardware ( keyboard ) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .
Runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !
It 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous .
It has a very high performance , just for what I needed for .
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .
I just bought the new MacBook Pro , the 13 '' model , and I ca n't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports .
It is the perfect size and speed for me .
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC ! !
My last laptop was a 17 '' ASUS gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago .
However , it did not have any scratches , ZERO battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .
And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse .
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .
I like coming back to Mac OS but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old HP laptop .
Shipped very quickly and safely .
The thunderbolt port is awesome !
The performance is definitely superior to any computer I 've ever put my hands on .
It 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved .
There were small problems with Mac office .
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 '' Imacs .
Its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
Performance is much much better on the Pro , especially if you install an SSD on it .
Note , however , that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection .
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too , I would recommend using a mouse with it .
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem .
It 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !
I am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - )
I will not be using that slot again .
The OS is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
They are simpler to use .
! so nice .. stable .. fast .. now i got my SSD !
I love the quick start up .
You just can not beat the functionality of an Apple device .
Yet my mac continues to function properly .
Graphics are much improved .
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity .
Mac tutorials do help .
The technical support was not helpful as well .
I got the new adapter and there was no change .
Logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .
OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable .
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did .
The Macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .
The Mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010- and for a good reason .
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple 's previous laptops .
3D rendering slows it down considerably .
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098+ tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax- 1070- OTD !
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $ 900+ level only , and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU ( similar to the $ 799 Mini ) , with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card ( this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card ) , and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously .
This mac does come with an extender cable and I 'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac .
The 2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .
Not sure on Windows 8 .
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive .
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class .
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .
Runs very smoothly .
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed .
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install , but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu .
Runs real quick .
Since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .
WiFi capability , disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .
The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .
Soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .
Simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
No HDMI port .
Customization on mac is impossible .
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
The SuperDrive is quiet .
The battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .
The OS is great .
CONS : Price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .
Which it did not have , only 3 USB 2 ports .
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch .
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8 .
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi .
Nice packing .
I switched to this because I wanted something different , even though I miss windows .
Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore , Apple does n't even offer it anymore !
I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has .
At first , I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system .
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS .
its as advertised on here ... .. it works great and is not a waste of money !
Premium price for the OS more than anything else .
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .
However , the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .
The battery is not as shown in the product photos .
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
Chatting with Acer support , I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office .
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player .
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better .
I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 '' LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time .
Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through .
Put a SSD and use a 21 '' LED screen , this set up is silky smooth !
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .
Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port , HDMI , ethernet and 3 USB ports .
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .
The nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC .
Was n't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different .
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .
working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features .
I like the brightness and adjustments .
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .
So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .
The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .
The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .
The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product .
I am loving the fast performance also .
Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the Mac OS ) and the range is poor .
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM .
Fine if you have a touch screen .
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING .
The OS is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 ( in PC enabled with USB3 ) I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .
I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs .
packing and everything was perfect
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
Cost is more as compared to other brands .
also ... - excellent operating system -- size and weight for optimal mobility -- excellent durability of the battery -- the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand-
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .
I 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .
the latest version does not have a disc drive .
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous .
