The food is very average ... the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
we love th pink pony .
THe perfect spot .
Ambiance relaxed and stylish .
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
The food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
The food was bland oily .
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
Service was prompt and courteous .
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
Salads were fantastic .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
The filet mignon dish was superb !
I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original .
The sushi is amazing ! ! !
Very affordable and excellent ambient !
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
We did n't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough .
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
Our food was great too !
And really large portions .
The food however , is what one might expect .
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
Very good wine choices .
Great staff .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
This place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
Waitstaff are very friendly .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
Service is average .
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
I would highly recommend this place !
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
I 'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
Authentic Taiwanese food that 's cheap ... what more could you ask for ?
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
Great neighborhood joint .
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice .
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .
Best Italian food I ever had ( and being Italian , that means alot ) .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee ! !
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
Everything about this restaurant was special .
You ca n't go wrong with this place .
The food is excellent !
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
Service is fast and friendly .
Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
What a great place !
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
Quick and friendly service .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .
People are always friendly .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
The food was actually aweful .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
Staff is very accomodating .
The decor is very simple but comfortable .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
even the wine by the glass was good .
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .
