Serves really good sushi .
Not the biggest portions but adequate .
Green Tea creme brulee is a must !
It has great sushi and even better service .
The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need .
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .
Good food !
This is a great place to get a delicious meal .
The staff is pretty friendly .
The onion rings are great !
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you ... ..were not good .
Nice ambience , but highly overrated place .
Worst Service I Ever Had
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .
Our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .
I complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .
Fabulous Italian Food !
– I highly recommend Mioposto .
I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood .
The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy .
I love this restaurant
– I will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance I experience at this restaurant .
The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .
The food was great !
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .
This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .
Caution - its real food for people who love the best .
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .
Rice is too dry , tuna was n't so fresh either .
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .
However , the value and service are both severely lacking .
Furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive .
On a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .
Freshest sushi – I love this restaurant .
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted .
Their apps are all delicious .
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .
But the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .
– The food was not great & the waiters were rude .
great service
my service was stellar !
food was fine , with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa .
the food was great , the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .
Best Sushi in town .
The best calamari in Seattle !
– ... and the best summertime deck experience -- they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather .
A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .
Endless fun , awesome music , great staff ! ! !
– By far the best bar in the east village ...
Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .
Definitely has one of the best jukebox 's i 've seen in a long long time .
The food is great , the bartenders go that extra mile .
The owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .
And the upstairs is a great place to hang out .
Not alot of smoking places left in New York , but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city .
The sushi here is delicious !
They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; Atlantic or Pacific .
I 've had the Jellyfish , Horse Mackerel , Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others , and they were all good .
The decor is rustic , traditional Japanese .
The service was courteous and attentive .
Mediocre food
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .
We are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists .
Service was decent .
Drinks were good .
Excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive
– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .
The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney .
Best Indian food in L.A .
The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .
The chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent .
It 's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .
Never too crowded and always great service .
I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .
I appreciate their delivery too .
Nice food but no spice !
– I really enjoyed my meal here .
I had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .
The food was all good but it was way too mild .
The naan was some of the best I 've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .
Even the chickpeas , which I normally find too dry , were good .
– I do n't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious .
I love the warm & cosy environment .
best restaurant in the world , great decor , great customer service , friendly manager
i am never disappointed with there food .
the atmosphere is great .
great lunch spot
– Great financial district mexican spot .
Always busy , but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service .
Everything I 've had here is good , taco salads , burritos , enchiladas i love this place .
Also have great margaritas !
The food is simply unforgettable !
The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful .
Holy Hummus !
– The food is here is incredible , though the quality is inconsistent during lunch .
Dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .
The side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) .
Also , they serve THE best hummus in America , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , I believe is the traditional way ) !
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .
However , this place is a gem , and I wo n't stop going back .
great beer
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .
The band was very good and the service was attentive .
We ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .
Seattle 's BEST Winelist
The sommelier is fantastic , down-to-earth , & extremely knowlegable .
The food is not what it once was ( potions have seriously seen downsizing ) prices have gone up , and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere ( including mainland Europe ) .
Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee
– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu .
The coffe is very good , too .
Great open and friendly ambience .
This place is charming and relaxing .
The servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful .
It 's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends .
Great food , spectacular location , and friendly service keep us coming back year after year .
Enjoyed the food
Food was good and cheap .
I had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it .
Atmosphere was nice .
Service was kind of slow , our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n't that busy .
Still I would recommend this place .
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW
Great food with an awesome atmosphere !
– Eggs , pancakes , potatoes , fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious .
great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect ! ! ! !
plus , i am allergic to rice , and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- did n't even bat an eye !
and the waiter suggested a perfect sake ! !
Unbeatable sushi !
Melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi , and very tasty rolls too .
Be sure to try the oyster roll .
– How to describe the best sushi in NYC : hmmmm , delicious , amazing , fantastic , suculent , perfect , nah , all of the above .
The best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had .
Good Sushi , High Price
One of the best Sushi place in town .
The house special roll is really good .
– I ca n't believe Murphy 's has been around for over 25 years , amazing .
Brunch at Murphy 's is to die for , my specialty ... egg white omelet , the food is always freshly prepared .
It 's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous !
Save room for scrumptious desserts .
The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n't forget !
– Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district .
Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials .
Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated , the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly .
The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .
The atmosphere was just okay .
Space was limited , but the food made up for it .
We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .
The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I could n't eat it .
Great food , better Margaritas !
– This is one of my top lunch spots , huge portions , fast service and amazing margaritas ! !
it gets really busy , so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat , if you do have to wait , its not bad because the service is quick !
Check out the art on the walls , very colorful !
i love this place !
– i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal .
The lunch menu is an awesome deal !
plenty of food , trust me .
Fresh ingrediants and super tasty .
Best food , phenominal service
For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer , the fish is the freshest and the service is superb .
Not only can the selection be innovative , but there 's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well .
The nicest waiters in town .
– This place is unbelievably over-rated .
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then I would put Murphy 's at the top of the list .
The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .
Your a sushi fan , you love expertly cut fish , great sake , a killer SOHO location , and of course : Salmon , Tuna , Fluke , Yellow Tail , Cod , Mackeral , Jellyfish , Sea Urchin , Shrimp , Lobster , Sea Bream , Trout , Milk Fish , Blue Fin Tuna , Eel , Crab , Sardine , Monk Fish , Roe , Scallop , Oysters , and a varity of Toro .
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world : BLUE RIBBON SUSHI .
Hands down , the best tuna I have ever had .
Blue Ribbon lives up to it 's fantastic reputation .
Great value sushi with high quality & nice setting .
Try the Chef 's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .
Poor customer service / poor pizza .
– As with most restaurants in Seattle , Mioposto 's service was bad and the food was overpriced .
I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but Mioposto 's pizza lacks quality and good taste .
To be honest , I 've had better frozen pizza .
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location .
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we 've eaten here more than 10 times .
The food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we 've been there .
Seabass on lobster risotto was the best .
Caesar salad was superb .
Great bottle of wine .
The food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .
AVOID THE PLACE
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !
We left without ever getting service .
Best Crab Cakes in Town
Great seasonal fish and seafood , with a classy waterfront setting .
Great Pizza , Poor Service
– Love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .
Also love their caeser salad .
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .
Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .
It 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate-like .
Great Breakfast
The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .
I love breakfast here .
Their crab eggs benedict is addicting .
All their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .
Chintzy portions
– The sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for NYC ) .
Terrible service , food ok , pricey
Food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao -- um um um ) .
As usual the omikase did n't disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .
Their specialty rolls are impressive , though I ca n't remember what we had .
Great selection of sakes .
It is n't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .
Very poor customer service .
– Schooner or Later 's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .
While this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .
the fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .
great service .
good sake selection .
– Ray 's is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners .
I love Dungeness crabs and at Ray 's you can get them served in about 6 different ways !
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .
I ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy !
And the service was simply spendid - quite a delight .
Great Breakfast
– Great drinks , corn beef hash , coffee , B Fast burritos , Gluten Free menu .
The service is fantastic at this fun place .
Best Neighborhood Standby .
In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .
The music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .
Oh , and the cheese fries are awesome !
Good Food , Great Service , Average Prices ( For the Strip )
When I walked in , I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .
The music playing was very hip , 20-30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .
I got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .
It was n't the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was OK .
I picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .
The steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .
It ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .
But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .
good sake , good food – i honestly do n't know much about japanese food at all .
Server made several sake suggestions which were very good .
had many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways .
The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .
Most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .
At best , the food was good and definately overpriced .
My favortie pizza joint in Seattle
The pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic .
I 've always found the wait staff and , if you sit at the bar , the cooks very friendly .
I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant .
– My husband and I love eating at Mioposto Café .
You won ’ t be disappointed by their menu .
The pizza ’ s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings .
Try the Pizza Ensalata !
The pizza ’ s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you ’ re ordering .
The food is sinful .
The staff was really friendly .
The atmosphere was great .
The specialty here is decadent pancakes , but I 've been back now four times , and I 've been wowed every time .
Nothing on the menu is less than amazing .
Good eats .
I have been to this place , folks and it is BAD .
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that 's half-way decent .
I have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .
– The atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .
The best dish are the honwy walnut prawns -- just outstanding .
The service is really attentive and charming .
The service was excellent , the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding .
– I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had .
The food is fantastic , authentic , delicious and very , very affordable .
The decor was beautiful and unique .
There was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music , atmosphere and happy looking people .
Our server was very professional and friendly .
It 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( Thurs ? Sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .
Everything , and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .
The sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !
If you 're interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ...
big thick pepperoni
– The pepperoni 's cut real thick -- Yum .
The pizza itself is not exactly the best I 've had EVER , but still pretty good .
Food was good and appetizing .
Portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .
Fair menu selection .
The appetizer was interesting , but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious .
Indoor ambience was modern .
It 's a great place to people watch .
Late night dinning with exeptional food .
We were seated right away , the table was private and nice .
The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .
The food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best I 've ever try .
The portions are big though , so do not order too much .
Groovy music made the dinner casual .
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .
The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .
– Mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !
The atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing ...
The catering is out of this world , and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !
Drinks are suberb , and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door .
- Mediocre Service / Quality
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .
They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .
The pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) .
Much more than just a great view !
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray 's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .
Ray 's is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous Sound views , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray 's !
To start things off , our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .
For my entr & eacute ; e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .
I had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .
Oh yeah ... the view was good , too .
